This is a silly Chrome extension which changes the Twitter verified tick to an icon that says "$8".

**9th Nov: It's still pending review by Google**: you can't get it from the Chrome Web Store yet ðŸ¥º

If you want to run it yourself, you can:

1. [download the source](https://github.com/samthor/hey-elon/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. unzip the file
3. go to `chrome://extensions`
4. click "Load unpacked" and choose the folder.

## Why

Eh.
Twitter is on its way out, let's have fun until it dies.
